      <p>"Clair de Lune," composed by Claude Debussy, is one of the most iconic pieces in classical music. It was written in the late 19th century to early 20th century. This particular rendition was in 2014 for the video game "The Evil Within". The sound duets the piano that the song usually features with a violin.</p>

      <h2>My Past with Clair de Lune</h2>
      <p>This song was a favorite of mine during the lockdown, the time of my biggest academic and academic growth. I often listened to it while studying especially during the pandemic. Even today this song is still one of my favorites, so if I feel stressed the calming rhythm helps to calm me down. It also is a reminder of the better days when I was able to grow free of barriers.</p>

      <h2>Why I Listen Clair de Lune</h2>
      <p> The song has a violin dueted by piano. This reflects the two sides of me one of a quiet person who wants to lay low and is slow. The other side of me that's more lively and wants improvement. The song has a pattern of rising and then falling before rising again. This is just like my life, where I improve and I improve, but I still falter. Then I get back up and keep improving.</p>
