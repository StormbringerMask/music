      <h2>About the Music</h2>
      <p>"Clair de Lune," composed by Claude Debussy, is one of the most iconic pieces in classical music. It was written in the late 19th century to early 20th century. This particular rendition was in 2014 for the video game "The Evil Within". The sound duets the piano that the song usually features with a violin.</p>
