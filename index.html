      <h2>About the Music</h2>
      <p>
        "Clair de Lune," composed by Claude Debussy, is one of the most iconic pieces in classical music. 
        Part of the "Suite Bergamasque," it evokes the beauty and serenity of moonlight, with gentle and 
        flowing melodies that captivate the soul.

      <h2>My Past with Clair de Lune</h2>
      <p>
        This piece has been a part of my life since childhood. I first heard it during quiet evenings 
        when my parents would play it on the piano. It became a symbol of calm and nostalgia for me, 
        a soothing presence during challenging times.

      <h2>Why Clair de Lune Represents Me</h2>
      <p>
        Clair de Lune mirrors my personality—gentle, reflective, and complex. Its flowing melodies 
        reflect my thoughts and emotions, often serene yet layered with depth. It is not just music; 
        it is a part of my identity.
